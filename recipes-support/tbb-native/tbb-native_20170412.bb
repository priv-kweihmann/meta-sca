DESCRIPTION = "Parallelism library for C++ - runtime files \
    TBB is a library that helps you leverage multi-core processor \
    performance without having to be a threading expert. It represents a \
    higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts platform details \
    and threading mechanism for performance and scalability."
