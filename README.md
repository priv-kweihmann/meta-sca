## Important note <!-- omit in toc -->

As announced by [this discussion](https://github.com/priv-kweihmann/meta-sca/discussions/8723) at the end of April 2022 this layer will undergo a major change in support.

Support will be given only for `master` branch

### What can I do when I'm affected by the changes

A maintainers guide can be found [here](docs/maintainer_guide.md).
Feel free to raise pull requests against not officially supported branches.

Support for these branches, including quality control, has to be done fully by the community

## Purpose

Purpose of this layer is to provide a proper set of static analysis tools for your YOCTO build.
All provided tools can be easily configured and integrated into any CI service (like e.g. Jenkins).

All results are stored to __SCA_EXPORT_DIR__ (which defaults to __${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/sca__). The results will be stored in the raw-format of the corresponding tool and in checkstyle-format.

## Getting started

For a quick start how to use this layer see [getting started guide](docs/getting_started.md)

## Installation

To install clone the needed branch(es) to any path on your local system.

### Prerequisites

- You need the current standard [__poky__-layer](https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/) installed onto your local build environment.
- You need **glib-2.0-dev** package installed on your build host (used for e.g. configcheck, lynis, tiger, upc)

### Use of containers

It is recommended to use `privkweihmann/yocto-sca-minimal:latest` docker container for building, which has all necessary requirements already installed.

### Use in CI

When you're planing to use meta-sca in your CI/CD, it is advised to use the minified layer [meta-sca-minified](https://github.com/priv-kweihmann/meta-sca-minified) to save you from cloning this fairly large repository.

**NOTE** [meta-sca-minified](https://github.com/priv-kweihmann/meta-sca-minified) only offer releases of this layer for releases made after 03/2020

### Setup

In your __bblayers.conf__-file add the following line

``` shell
BBLAYERS += "<full path to sca-layer>/meta-sca"
```

or with poky layer already setup run in shell

```shell
bitbake-layers add-layer "<full path to sca-layer>/meta-sca"
```

### Kas

Alternatively you can use [kas](https://kas.readthedocs.io) to setup the workspace.
Use `conf/kas/scatest-qemux86-64.yaml` from this layer

## Web monitor

If you're not quite convinced what this layer can do for you, have a look at the [web monitor](https://priv-kweihmann.github.io/), where all findings from the layer CI pipelines are publically available.

## Support

Actively maintained branch is currently only `master`.
Unmaintained branches will only receive package updates on demand.
Support for unmaintained branches has to be done by the community.

Status of the branches is described at [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

It's advised to use the tagged source versions in productive environment.

#### Releases

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details

### Compatibility

If there is a technical issue that might break backward compatibility it will be mentioned in release note of the corresponding milestone release.

## Licensing

This layer does only provide open source tools.
The layer itself is licensed under BSD.

If individual files are licensed under different terms, terms and conditions
can be found in the individual file header

## Zero impact

This layer provides only **-native** tools, so actually none of the build binaries will be deployed to your target.
Everything happens on the build machine.

There are some excludes to this rule (e.g. lynis) as they need to be cross-compiled to make use of them, nevertheless
none of these tools will be installed automatically to your build.

## Available tools

The layer can check on a recipe-level or on an image-level.

- On image-level the whole root-filesystem could be taken into account, which in most cases can't be granted on a recipe-level.
- On the other hand some static code analysis does not make any sense on an image-level - so this layer does have different tools for both level available.
